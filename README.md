# chat
I created a server file in node.js using express,socket.io modules and connected the public folder using express.static in it.

The public folder contains index.html(which appear in the browser)
                           chat.js(client file which connects to server)
                           style.css(which add styles to html file)

The client file is connected to the server file using socket.io and added a javascript code to work a html file as we chat normally.
It is a simple javascript code by using eventlistners and on pressing the send button chat wil appear on the chat window to all persons whoever are connected to the port.
